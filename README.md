# [L4D & L4D2] Graves

DESCRIPTION: 

When a survivor dies, a grave appears near his body, and this grave 
glows through the objects on the map, allowing a quick location from 
where the survivor died. This can be useful for use with a defibrillator 
(L4D2), or even for those who use the "Emergency Treatment With First 
Aid Kit Revive And CPR" (L4D) plugin, for example. 

Anyway, I made this more for fun than for some utility.

This plugin is also based on the Tuty plugin (CSS Graves). It can be
found here:
