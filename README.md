# [L4D & L4D2] Graves

## DESCRIPTION: 

This is a SourceMod plugin.

When a survivor dies, a grave appears near his body, and this grave glows through the objects on the map, allowing a quick location from where the survivor died. 

And when the survivor respawn, the grave associated with him disappears.

In addition, there are six types of grave that are chosen randomly.

Maybe can be useful for use with a defibrillator (L4D2), or even for those who use the "Emergency Treatment With First Aid Kit Revive And CPR" (L4D) plugin, for example. 

Anyway, I made this more for fun than for some utility.

This plugin is also based on the Tuty plugin (CSS Graves), which can be found here:
